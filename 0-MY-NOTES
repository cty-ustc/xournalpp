Compilation
-----------

````bash
git clone http://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp.git
cd xournalpp
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/home/jr/local/pkgs/xournalpp--github-jaijeet--master--x86_64 . && make all
make
````

Use `cmake-gui ..` to see graphically all available options.

With Cairo 1.16 PDF Bookmarks will be possible, but this Version is not yet
common available, therefore the Cairo PDF Export is without PDF Bookmarks.

The binary executable will be in `build/src/` subdirectory.

To install all needed files execute:
```bash
sudo make install
```


TODOS
-----

- xournalpp already has means to customize menus and it works, so that does not need fixing
- if you set a page grid (including vertical grid size = 1, horiz grid size open), then you get horiz scrolling
- F11 works for toggling fullscreen, which is better than having to press a button
- xournalpp comes with basic drawing primitives (line, arrow, rect, circle, etc.)
----
1. Get rid of the left right border - DONE (branch jr-fixHorizBorder)
2. Fix the scaling to fit height button (and call it so)
3. More pen sizes - at least one more (VERYFINE)
